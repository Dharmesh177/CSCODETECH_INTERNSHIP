To begin with, I chose them for their professionalism and prompt replies, but they offered a lot more than that. I’d bet my fortune on the fact that iCoderz has to be in the top 3 development shops to work with on Elance. "</p>

<p><span class="quote-sign"><img class="" loading="lazyload" data-src="img/quote-sign.png" src="img/quote-sign.png"/></span>" We have been using Ashish and his team for over 3 years now. We have posted several projects, each worth a few thousand dollars, and they have delivered them punctually every single time! I guess that pretty much sums up the excellent experience we have had with iCoderz (Ashish and Team)! They have excellent communication skills in English, very prompt in replying and extremely hard working as a team. I have been in IT for over 25 years now and this team has been a lucky find for us. I have a few more projects lined up and will be using them again. Highly recommended! "</p>
